He has incredible design, coding, and critical thinking skills. He is also proactive and goes the extra mile in his work. I contracted him to build a complex website, and throughout its creation, there were numerous moments where he could have just done the bare minimum to get paid but that’s not Marvin’s style. He cares about the quality of his work and spends extra time coming up with enhancements and creative solutions to problems.
