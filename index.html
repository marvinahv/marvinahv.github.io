  <h1 id="marvin-alejandro-herrera-vizuett">Marvin Alejandro Herrera Vizuett</h1>
<p>I design and build web applications. I like making things that make the world better. I believe the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Minimalism and simplicity are awesome.</p>
<h2 id="programming-skills">Programming Skills</h2>
<p>I like writing clean and readable code. I like to be DRY and KISS. I love modular stuff. I’m into micro-services. I’m always learning new stuff. I have architected and built web applications and sites from the ground up.</p>
<h3 id="html">HTML</h3>
<p>I advocate for writing semantic html code. This together with a good css architecture make for organized, clean, and re-usable code. It’s hard to believe, but there are still developers who use tables for layouts.</p>
<p>I used <a href="http://haml.info/">haml</a> a lot, until I discovered <a href="http://slim-lang.com/">slim</a> and fell in love with it. I use that as a default in most of my projects. The ability to have modular code with partials and layouts, and the python-like syntax make writing and organizing code a breeze.</p>
<p>When working with backbone.js or other javascript mvcs I have used <a href="https://mustache.github.io/">mustache</a> and other logic-less templates. In particular, I’m pretty fond of <a href="http://twitter.github.io/hogan.js/">hogan.js</a>. I’ve also worked with <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">handlebars</a>. They’re all pretty much the same.</p>
<p>In a project where they were using PHP, I used <a href="http://www.smarty.net/">smarty</a>. But I like Ruby better. </p>
<h3 id="css">CSS</h3>
<p>I have been writing css for a long time and I’ve learnt most of the tricks for making it do what you want it to do (it often doesn’t: ex. vertical-align). I also try to stay current with new features and best practices for it.</p>
<p>Since I discovered <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">sass</a> years ago, I’ve never looked back. I have used <a href="http://lesscss.org/">less</a> in the past, but in my opinion, sass is way better.</p>
<p>I love architecting my styles in modules and sass is perfect for that. Also, using @mixins, functions, and @extends allow me to have really DRY code. I usually use <a href="http://compass-style.org/">compass</a> in my sass projects with a couple of compass plugins, especially <a href="http://susy.oddbird.net/">susy</a> for custom grids. I’ve also used <a href="http://bourbon.io/">bourbon</a>. Responsive code is much easier with sass, for me.</p>
<p>Frameworks-wise, I’ve used <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a> in many projects, but I’m not a big fan of it. I think it’s not very semantic and it’s too heavy. I’ve explored several others, but I really like to use <a href="http://purecss.io/">pure.css</a> because it’s really minimal but has all the basics and it’s really small. I find it better to just have a foundation and then build upon that with my own design without having to override too much.</p>
<h3 id="javascript">JavaScript</h3>
<p>I have a lot of experience using JS to manipulate the DOM. I’ve used jQuery extensively, used and written jQuery plugins for a long time.</p>
<p>Now, I usually write <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">coffeescript</a>, but I understand what the underlaying JS code is doing and I could do the same thing with vanilla javascript.</p>
<p>I have used a couple of JavaScript MVC frameworks, but I have the most experience with <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">backbone.js</a> and is one of my favorites, again because of its modularity and non-holistic-framework architecture. I’m currently learning <a href="http://marionettejs.com/">marionette.js</a> for using backbone in bigger applications. </p>
<p>I’m also learning <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">meteor.js</a> and other, more traditional node.js frameworks, such as <a href="http://expressjs.com/">express.js</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to that, I use <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/">mongodb</a> as my default database. I prefer JSON over XML. </p>
<h3 id="ruby">Ruby</h3>
<p>I love Ruby. I use Ruby to make the simplest programs and it is my tool of choice for web applications.</p>
<p>I originally learnt Ruby to use <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>, but then started using it for task automation, web-scrapping and just everyday scripting.</p>
<p>At first I really enjoyed using Rails, but soon became frustrated with its “magic”. I started using <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html">Sinatra</a> and learned to do myself what rails used to do for me. Eventually, I started using <a href="http://www.padrinorb.com/">Padrino</a> (which is like a mix of sinatra and rails) for bigger projects.</p>
<p>Now I really like the idea of micro-services and I’m using sinatra more and more together with backbone.js.</p>
<h3 id="databases">Databases</h3>
<p>I really like <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/">mongodb</a> and I use it quite a lot. I love its flexibility. I’ve also used <a href="http://redis.io/">redis</a> and I’m currently learning <a href="http://neo4j.com/">neo4j</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve also used PostgreSQL for relational databases. In Ruby, I’ve used ActiveRecord with rails and <a href="http://datamapper.org/">DataMapper</a> in other projects as ORMs. But I can also write my own custom queries when needed.</p>
<p>I believe in using the right tool for the right job.</p>
<h3 id="web">Web</h3>
<p>In addition to knowing different technologies for making web applications, I know how to make them work together to create something good. Knowing when to use the different tools, technologies, and architectures is as important as knowing each of them.</p>
<p>I also understand the request cycle, the browser’s incompatibilities and differences, and other important issues that must be taken into account for creating great experiences for the users using our products.</p>
<h3 id="other-languages">Other languages</h3>
<p>My first programming language was Java. After that, I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Then I learned PHP. And then I learned Ruby. I’m really interested in learning more languages.</p>
<h3 id="git">Git</h3>
<p>I’ve been using git for a while. I particularly like the <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">Git Branching Model</a> and I try to use it as much as possible. I use <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a> for private projects and GitHub for public ones (though I haven’t updated that in a while). </p>
<h2 id="non-programming-skills">Non-programming Skills</h2>
<h2 id="ux-design">UX Design</h2>
<p>I believe the UX part of any product is indispensable. I use design thinking for building the products I make. I spend a lot of time thinking, prototyping, testing, and improving the features I develop. A lot of the process is not seen (as it can be seen in code), but it is just as important as building it.</p>
<p>I think most of the time designing the features takes more time and thinking that actually coding them, but I think it is just as important.</p>
<h2 id="analysis-&-problem-solving">Analysis &amp; Problem Solving</h2>
<p>Just as I believe it is important to design a feature for the optimal experience and coding it in an elegant and beautiful manner, I believe that really solving the problem the users have is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>I try to really get to the root of the problem the user has and find a way to solve it. I think about this things a lot (I did study psychology for a while and I worked as a technical troubleshooter) as I’m building or designing something. I also try to find the simplest solution. </p>
<h2 id="fast-self-learning">Fast Self-learning</h2>
<p>I love learning and I love what I do. I’m constantly learning new languages, databases, frameworks, techniques, and best practices. I don’t know many things, but I have the ability to figure it out quickly and if I don’t know something, I will learn it as fast as possible. I truly believe everyone can learn anything. I consider myself a life-long learner.</p>
<h2 id="work/projects">Work/Projects</h2>
<p>These are some of the projects I’ve worked on and helped.</p>
<h3 id="creative-web-developer-—-byu-center-for-teaching-and-learning">“Creative Web Developer” — BYU Center for Teaching and Learning</h3>
<h4 id="jan-2011---aug-2012">Jan 2011 - Aug 2012</h4>
<p>I was a link between the Art Director and his designers and the programmers of our division. I would code prototypes or new designs for different applications.</p>
<p>I created several jQuery plugins for page interactions in the new BYU’s website and other internal applications. I was also responsible for creating and maintaining a style guide for those sites.</p>
<p>I was also responsible for pushing the use of Backbone.js in the Learning Suite (BYU’s own school management system). I created several prototypes and latter taught other programmers to use it and helped them implement it. </p>
<h3 id="front-end-web-developer-—-kalood.com">“Front-end Web Developer” — Kalood.com</h3>
<h4 id="may-2011---april-2012">May 2011 - April 2012</h4>
<p>I worked on a project-basis with Kalood, a Utah-based startup. I worked closely with the backend programmer to implement all the front-end functionality. I learned a lot during this time about web applications.</p>
<h3 id="sellthatcontract.com">SellThatContract.com</h3>
<h4 id="may-2013---present">May 2013 - Present</h4>
<p>I built this site from the ground up. This was my first big web application on my own. All the work was done remotely (STC is based in Utah).</p>
<p>The application is built in Ruby, with the Padrino framework. It is hosted in Heroku with a mongodb database.</p>
<p>The site has a lot of functionality, including email automation, scheduled tasks, custom integration with Stripe for payments, custom discounts system, admin analytics, auto-complete features, and many others.</p>
<p>The UX is simple but we are working on a redesign. We have focused a lot on building the features (which change often), testing and improving them. This has been on a contract-basis. </p>
<h3 id="brightpeople">BrightPeople</h3>
<p>I worked with <a href="http://brightpeople.mx/">Bright People</a> to build a custom application to help their business grow and for their workflow to be faster.</p>
<p>I was responsible for talking with the clients to understand their problems and bottle-necks and then to design and develop features in the application to help them solve those issues. </p>
<p>The application has a custom CRM, an agenda, a multi-person to-do list, custom yearly income analytics, client statistics, and email automation and task automation tasks.</p>
<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
<p>People I have worked with in the past. You can contact them for more information on their experience working with me. Most of them are in Utah or lived there a while. With two of them I’ve worked completely remotely from Mexico.</p>
<h3 id="[matt-smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smitty)"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/smitty">Matt Smith</a></h3>
<p>“Marvin is a creator that loves to make things better. His creative background is complemented with his knowledge of the technical. He has an ability to both come up with new solutions and to execute tasks assigned to him. He strives to do what is best for the company. Lastly, Marvin has a great personality, a sense of humor, and is easy to work with.”</p>
<h3 id="[steve-hale](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/steve-hale/26/574/714)"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/steve-hale/26/574/714">Steve Hale</a></h3>
<p>“Marvin is the total package. He has incredible design, coding, and critical thinking skills. He is also proactive and goes the extra mile in his work. I contracted him to build a complex website, and throughout its creation, there were numerous moments where he could have just done the bare minimum to get paid but that’s not Marvin’s style. He cares about the quality of his work and spends extra time coming up with enhancements and creative solutions to problems. Marvin is fun to work with, and I highly recommend him to those looking for someone to design and build their website.”</p>
<h3 id="[nate-walton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nwalton)"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nwalton">Nate Walton</a></h3>
<p>“Marvin is one of the best web developers I’ve ever worked with. He picks up new technologies and techniques quickly, he streamlines workflow to save everyone time, and he comes up with an elegant solution for whatever task he’s faced with. Most valuable to me as a designer is the fact that he also has good design sense, so there’s nothing lost between design and code. I highly recommend Marvin.”</p>
<p>“Marvin came up with some really effective, creative solutions for integrating dynamic data into a test a website I was building. He put together the technologies and working processes that allowed us to quickly iterate and expand on the site. Thanks to Marvin, we were able to put together a great site on time and on budget for our product pitch.”</p>
