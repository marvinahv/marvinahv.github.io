  quote: "Marvin is the total package. He has incredible design, coding, and critical thinking skills. He is also proactive and goes the extra mile in his work. I contracted him to build a complex website, and throughout its creation, there were numerous moments where he could have just done the bare minimum to get paid but that’s not Marvin’s style. He cares about the quality of his work and spends extra time coming up with enhancements and creative solutions to problems. Marvin is fun to work with, and I highly recommend him to those looking for someone to design and build their website."

He picks up new technologies and techniques quickly, he streamlines workflow to save everyone time, and he comes up with an elegant solution for whatever task he’s faced with. Most valuable to me as a designer is the fact that he also has good design sense, so there’s nothing lost between design and code. I highly recommend Marvin."
